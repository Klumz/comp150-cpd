# comp150-cpd

## Week 1
The first week is the week we met our classmates for the first time. Eventually we started working on a LEGO robot, where half of the team would assemble the robot itself while the other half programmed it to complete the various tasks that were given. A challenge I encountered was generally getting to know and communicate with each other, which is something I've been struggling with for longer than I'd like to admit. To improve on this, getting to know my surroundings and people should prove beneficial.  

## Week 2
This week, we practiced game ideation and applying them on paper. The challenge we faced involved using too much time and effort on the ideation itself and less on the working prototype. We addressed this by halting time spent on the ideation and more towards the working prototype, which we ended up completing right before demonstrating it to the class. 

## Week 3
We worked on designing another paper prototype for a text-based game this week, although in different groups. One of the two challenges I faced was adapting to a new group of people and putting myself out there. The other challenge was coming up with realistic ideas for the the prototype, as we became too ambitious at times. To address these, continuing getting to know each other should be helpful, as well as learning to narrow down ideas in order to avoid stretching them more than they need to be. 

## Week 4
This week, logic gates and computing memory were shown and explained to us, as well as tinkering-graphics related topics. The only challenge was focusing and understanding said topics in the lectures. I will address this by going over the appropriate slides again.

## Week 5 
During the comp120 lecture, we learned how to apply graphics such as printing "Hello world!" with different background colours. The challenging part was the actual application of said graphics, as I was quite uncertain on what you really had to type in order to get your wanted results. I overcame this challenge by reading the tutorial guides on pygame's website, and by taking a peek at the code that was submitted on Slack by other students to further understand and analyse what I was actually implementing. 

## Week 6
This week, we were introduced to scholarly writing and how to use both LaTeX and BibTeX formatting for our agile essays. I struggled with this at first since we had to manually find every piece of information for our sources, until I realised that there was a "Download citations" option at the IEEE Xplore website, which made the formatting much easier. Generally finding sources for my agile essay was the challenging part, as I was still uncertain on which research question I should be using. Searching around for interesting sources ahead of time should prove beneficial. 

## Week 7
This week, I was faced with a challenge of deciding a research question for my agile essay and preparing a presentation about it. I had a few vague ideas regarding that, although it was later revealed that I needed to construct a more specific question. Eventually, I decided to present my essay slides privately to my tutor, as I am generally not confident with presenting in front of other people, mostly due to my speaking/oral skills since English isn't exactly my native language. Despite all this, I eventually managed to construct a more specific question with help from my tutor for my agile essay. I will also practice my presentation skills more in order for me to improve both my confidence and oral skills.

## Week 8
This week, we had our sprint review for our comp-150 desktop game. This was our first session in a while where all the team members were present, which led to our productive time in improving and coming up with different ideas for our game. We all took turns and did pair-programming during this lecture, which I thought was helpful and provided clarity. A challenge we were eventually faced with was our Trello board, which wasn't specific enough and contained user stories that weren't thoroughly explained. Improving our user stories by adding more depth and descriptions to them should be the way to go in terms of addressing this challenge.

## Week 9 
This week, we were introduced to Travis CI, which nobody in our group managed to understand and implement properly. We tried utilising Travis with our desktop game, and although progress was being made, nothing ultimately came out of it other than a nice amount of emails from Travis telling me that "Build ## is still failing". Further tinkering with it should prove helpful. 

## Week 10
This week in the comp110 lectures, we were introduced to C++ and transitioning to that from Python, which was a challenge for me as I still do not feel confident with my Python skills. We will be using C++ along with the Unreal Engine with the BAs next year, so this will be necessary to learn before the time comes. I will try to refine my Python skills by getting more hands-on and looking at previous lecture slides, as well as guides online so that I can transition to C++ a little bit easier. 

## Week 11
In the comp110 lecture this week, we were shown various mathematical concepts and how to apply them. I found the lecture quite hard to follow, as I am not the best at math. This week we also used a lot of our time on finishing the rest of our desktop game, which we still had quite a bit to finish. Additionally, we had to finish our presentations as well. General time management was the major challenge with the project, which unsurprisingly was a stressful experience, although we managed to get a lot of work done over the weekend which was good. 

## Week 12
We took part in various viva sessions this week. A challenge I was faced with was properly explaining what my lines of code did, which could be greatly improved. After the viva sessions, my group member and I started pair programming our tinkering-audio project where we decided on letting me add a decay function, although with minimal help in order for me to understand it all thoroughly. While my group member did a great job at explaining parts of the code, it still took a good few hours for me to properly understand and implement the required lines. Going over the tinkering-audio slides and getting a little more hands-on with it should be considered.

# Semester 2
## Week 1
Back again after a long holiday break. This week was interesting as we were introduced to new things such as a lecturer, Brian McDonald, a new programming language such as C++ and Unreal Engine 4. A challenge this week was generally learning to use blueprints within the engine, however I am feeling more confident about it compared to traditional programming as it feels easier and beginner-friendly, despite them getting messy overtime. Also, surprisingly, I have come to realise that C++ feels slightly easier than Python somehow.  

## Week 2
Nothing much new. We mostly continued working on our game project. I finished the item pickup blueprint in the Unreal Engine for our game, although another BSc member already committed their version on Github which is fine, at least I have learned how to do it. A challenge this week was worksheet_B for comp130 which I found confusing. I submitted an incomplete submission but will try to finish it later on once I understand it.

## Week 3
Nothing much this week either. Though, a challenge I faced was making the inventory system for our game, as it was going to work differently compared to traditional inventory systems. I eventually looked up a tutorial online and managed to implement it while learning it during the process, albeit only a basic inventory for now. Rest of the team will check it out and see how we can modify it to suit the needs of our game. 

## Week 4
Deadlines are approaching, particularly our game project. Collaboration with the BAs this week was quite unstable. We addressed this by all grouping up together right before the weekend and worked on getting assets in and general integration, which proved to be successful.
